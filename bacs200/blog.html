                    The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly birthed many controversies between the right and left. The argument over 
                    whether one has the right to not wear a mask still goes on today, about 1 and a half years into the pandemic. 
                    Mask mandates are still in effect for a lot of highly populated areas in order to reduce the spread of the vaccine. 
                    Now that multiple renditions of the vaccine have been developed, many are arguing that it is unsafe, and are opting 
                    not to get it. I am here to argue that the vaccine is safe, and that there is no good reason not to get it.

                <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                <p>
                    COVID-19 has negatively affected everyone in many ways over the past 20 years. The virus is highly contagious, meaning 
                    that ever since the start of the pandemic, people have been asked to stay home as often as possible. Even in social areas,
                    masks are usually either highly encouraged or required. This has hurt everyone socially, especially 2020 high school graduates
                    who were forced to have a year of online college. Getting the vaccine means that you are helping this struggle come to an end 
                    for everyone socially. Generally, it is more socially acceptable to get the vaccine in densely populated areas, where the 
                    spread of the disease is most likely to happen, whereas the opposite is generally true for less populated areas. This may 
                    also be because of politics.

                <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                <p>
                    The pandemic has also had many economic consequences over the past few years. Because of the stay at home orders and mask mandates,
                    many small businesses are closing their doors due to their inability to make a sustainable profit. This isn’t just affecting big 
                    businesses however. Large businesses have often been forced to all work from home, which puts a huge hindrance on production in
                    general. In addition, an outbreak in an area may mean a lot of premature deaths, causing even more of a hindrance on productivity.
                    Many corporations are now requiring their employees to get vaccinated, which has resulted in a large decrease in the spread of the 
                    disease. However, there is still quite a bit of controversy over whether corporations should be allowed to require their employees 
                    to get vaccinated. I would argue that corporations should be allowed to do this, as long as the person receiving the vaccine has some 
                    sort of allergy that prevents them from receiving it.

                <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                <p>
                    With almost everything currently depending on politics, it is a bit hard to distinguish between the social and political implications 
                    of the vaccine. Usually, the two are so intertwined that the vaccine cannot be brought up without going into a whole political debate. 
                    Most right winged people would say that the vaccine isn't safe, and is premature, where most left winged people would encourage others 
                    to get it. Luckily, most right winged people live in sparsely populated areas with a low risk, and most left winged people live in densely 
                    populated areas with a high risk. However, just because someone is at low risk doesn't mean they are immune to COVID, so I would argue that 
                    everyone should make an effort to get the vaccine.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            Many argue that the vaccines are unsafe, either because they are too new or they may cause life threatening side-effects. The vaccines were able to
            be developed quickly, but this does not mean they were inadequately tested or premature. Their quick development was caused by a number of reasons, 
            such as their use of mRNA, allowing for a faster approach, and the technology of mRNA vaccines having already been in development for decades. The 
            vaccines can cause side-effects, such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) 
            among a few others. These side-effects, however, are extremely rare. Only about one thousand reports have been made out of the hundreds of millions who 
            have gotten the vaccine. In my opinion, the benefits seem to outweigh the risk.
