					<h3 style="color:lightgreen;">Areas of Growth</h3>
					<h5 style="color:lightgreen;">These are the skills that I currently need to work on</h5>
					<section>
						<h3>Area 1: General IT Knowledge</h3>
						<p style="font-size:20px;">My current general knowlege of IT is a bit lacking compared to many of my other intern peers at Amazon. This is mainly due to the limited IT resources I had growing up.</p>

						<ul style="font-size:20px;">
							My plan:
							<li>Study current IT trends</li>
							<li>Learn something new in IT every day, no matter how small</li>
							<li>Ask questions and gain knowledge from my peers</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Area 2: AWS Knowledge</h3>
						<p style="font-size:20px;">Even though I have worked at AWS before, my knowledge of their services and how they work still feels limited. This is needed, as Open 3D Engine is integrated closely with AWS.</p>
						<ul style="font-size:20px;">
							My plan:
							<li>Learn something new about an AWS service every day</li>
							<li>Take a course on AWS</li>
							<li>Stay in contact with my old manager/mentor if I have any questions</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Area 3: Game Development</h3>
						<p style="font-size:20px;">I have spent many hours working in Unity and Unreal Engine, but there is still so much I can improve on in this area, especially with Open 3D Engine specifically.</p>
						<ul style="font-size:20px;">
							My plan:
							<li>Spend at least 30 minutes playing around with Open 3D Engine each day</li>
							<li>Watch tutorials on Open 3D Engine</li>
							<li>Keep myself updated on game development trends</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Level of experience</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Novice      - 1 hour
						</li>
						<li>
							Beginner    - 10 hours
						</li>
						<li>
							Competent   - 100 hours
						</li>
						<li>
							Proficient  - 1,000 hours
						</li>
						<li>
							Expert      - 10,000 hours
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>My level of experience with game deveolpment and programming is likely proficient. I have worked on many projects throughout my life, but still feel as if there is a lot more to learn.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/skills/goal.jpeg" >
					<h3>Growth Objective</h3>
					<p>I will aim to invest at least an hour a day into honing my skills.</p>
					<p>As mentioned in the Areas of Growth section, I plan to spend 30 minutes learning game development, 15 minutes learning general IT stuff, and 15 minutes learning about AWS.</p>
