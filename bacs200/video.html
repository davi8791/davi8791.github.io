                        Hello, my name is Matthew Davis! I am currently a sophomore at the University of Northern Colorado pursuing a degree in Software
                        Engineering. I come from a small town in Northeastern Colorado called Peetz. As one can imagine, my small high school of 32 students
                        didn't have any programming classes. Though, I have been teaching myself programming ever since I was in 6th grade. Since then, I
                        have been doing a lot of hobby coding to keep my skills sharp, such as simple games that could be played on our school chromebooks,
                        or tools, for instance to aid in the creation of caption files. I even wound up teaching a small online class on HTML, CSS, and a
                        tad of JavaScript. Last summer, I landed an internship with Amazon as a software engineer for AWS Batch. This internship taught me
                        so much, gave me a lot of early experience, and showed me what it was like working in the industry. It was also a lot of fun, and I
                        even ended up getting a return offer for next summer. I would say that my five greatest skills are learning new things quickly, web
                        design, game development with Unity and Unreal engine, proficiency in version control, and writing clean, effective object-oriented
                        code. Because of my ability to learn new things quickly, I can do whatever a prospective company would need me to do as a software
                        engineer, whether it be frontend, backend, or both. I am currently very proficient in the languages JavaScript, Java, Python, and C#.
                        I also can effectively write HTML and CSS for web pages, if that is ever needed. I also have experience in the industry from my internship
                        with Amazon, and will have even more after this next summer. Thanks for watching, and have a good day!
                    </p>
