    <h1>My Favorite Hero</h1>
    <p>Great men and women are hard to find.</p>
    <p>But I know of one.</p>
    <h1>Bob Ross - The Happy Painter</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>For those who are unaware, Bob Ross was an American painter, most active through the 80s and 90s. 
    He was the star of a television show called The <em>Joy of Painting</em>, a relaxing television show that 
    featured him painting beautiful landscape scenes.</p>
    <p>A lesser known fact about Bob Ross is that he was actually a member of the United States airforce
    from 1961 to 1981. Being in the airforce allowed him to travel all around the US. He spent a lot of his 
    time in Alaska, and this is actually where he drew inspiration for most of his paintings.</p>
    <p>Bob Ross passed away at the age of 52 on July 4, 1995. He left quite the legacy, however, and has 
    inspired me to enjoy and be more appreciative of life.</p>
    <h2>How He Inspires Me</h2>
    <p>Bob Ross inspires me to be more appreciative of life. I have watched a great number of episodes of
    his show <em>Joy of Painting</em>, and I understand how caring and kind of a person he is. It doesn't matter
    how good of a painter you are to him. As he famously said: <em>"We don't make mistakes -- we just have happy accidents."</em>
    His kind personality is also reflected in his paintings. He even makes sure that the trees have friends. He doesn't like
    lonely trees, since <em>"everyone needs a friend."</em></p>
