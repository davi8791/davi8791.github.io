                        <p>When you are browsing the web, do you ever come across one of those pop-ups that ask if you need assistance finding something on a website? Chances are, if you interacted with one of those, you were speaking to a robot. Maybe you didn't even realize it!</p>
                        <p>AI powered chatbots can mimic human conversations, and answer questions almost instantly. Through the use of machine learning these chatbots can be easily mistaken for human.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">When did this start?</h2>
                        <p><a href="drift.com/blog/state-of-conversational-marketing/?utm_source=salesforce&utm_medium=blog">Recent statistics</a> have shown that 24.9% of consumers used chatbots to interact with businesses, where about 13% did in 2018</p>
                        <p>This was likely due to the large advances that have recently been made on deep and machine learning, so chatbots are easier for humans to interact with.</p>
                        <p>Another reason behind this is known as mobile app fatigue. Basically, if you were to develop a really good mobile app, chances are, people would have a hard time finding it due to the overcrowded mobile application market. So, brands instead rely on chatbots through existing messaging channels in order to advertise their products.</p>
                        <p>In addition to all this, popularity of instant messaging apps is growing. <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1523/mobile-messenger-apps/">According to 2019 statistics from Statisa</a>, people sent over 41 million mobile messages in one minute! It is no secret that people seem to prefer immediate communications.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">What benefiets do they have?</h2>
                        <p>Along with providing the user answers to their questions in seconds to miliseconds, chatbots have proven to be very cost-efficient.</p>
                        <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/chatbots-to-deliver-11bn-cost-savings-2023">according to Juniper Research</a>, adopting chatbots for certain organisations would save them $11bn by 2023.</p>
                        <p>If you werent already afraid of having your job taken by a robot, now would be a good time to start panicking.</p>
