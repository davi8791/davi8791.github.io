                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>If you had to choose between using light mode or dark mode on your phone for the rest of your life, which would you pick? Chances are, you chose dark mode, as about 85% of the US population use it over light mode. And to be completely honest, I don't think I have ever met someeone who does prefer light mode over dark mode. But why is this?</p>
                        <p>Along with people claiming that dark mode is "easier on the eyes"(more on this later), UX designers say that dark mode helps text, buttons and other elements stick out more to the user, making them easier to focus on. In addition, people tend to think that a dark theme looks more sophisticated and modern.</p>
                        <p>Dark mode has been around for a very long time, but the trend took off with Apple around 2019 with the release of a dark mode for the iOS 13 update.</p>
                        <p>More and more companies have since released dark modes (sometimes referred to as night mode) for their applications, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Google.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Eye health</h2>
                        <p>So what are some of the practical advantages of having a darker background to your pages? First, there are actually <a href="https://ssb22.user.srcf.net/css/dark.html">many different reasons</a> why dark mode is easier on the eyes. In addition, certain things like syntax or grammar highlighting can be much more noticable against a darker background.</p>
                        <p>Studies have shown that, especially in low-light areas, a dark mode can help reduce eye strain or fatigue that would otherwise be present when looking at a bright white background.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Saving power</h2>
                        <p>Eye health is not the only reason to add a night mode to your application, as it can also <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-promotes-the-use-of-Dark-Mode_id110831">save hours of battery life</a> on your mobile devices.</p>
                        <p>Dark pixels require much less energy to render to a screen then white pixels. Thousands of normally bright white pixels rendered on a screen for a background are turned black by dark mode.</p>
                        <p>Tests done by Google have shown that using YouTube in dark mode can save up to 60% of your battery power! If that's not a reason to switch to dark mode, I don't know what is.</p>
                        <p>As this trend continues to grow, surely more and more applications will start using a darker theme. I certainly hope so, as its much more energy and eye efficient.</p>
