                        <p>Here's the question: How often do you use your smartphone to browse the web compared to your computer? You may be suprized to learn that about 50% of web traffic is done from a mobile device.</p>
                        <p>Businesses have taken note of this to, and many of them are beginning to take a mobile-first approach to their web development.</p>
                        <p>A mobile-first approach means to develop your application/website with mobile devices in mind over other computers. This would ensure that the page is well optimized and easy to use from a smartphone.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/what-users-want-most-from-mobile-sites-today/">According to Google</a>, however, nearly 75% of users prefer a mobile-friendly site but 96% of consumers say they've come across pages that weren't designed with mobile devices in mind.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What sparked this change?</h2>
                        <p>The term mobile-first was first coined by Luke Wroblewski in 2009, but it was not made famous until 2010 by Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google.</p>
                        <p>As mobile devices are becoming more and more powerful, people are beginning to rely on them a lot more. To put this into perspective, my Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphone, something that I carry around in my pocket everywhere I go, has the power of a top-notch computer from 10 years ago.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What benefeits are there?</h2>
                        <p>To me, it makes perfect sense why people would by wanting to browse the internet more and more on their smartphones. Yet many companies still think that taking a mobile-first approach is a bad idea.</p>
                        <p>Luckily, Googleâ€™s Core Web Vitals updated this year to give pages with great user experience higher priority in thier search engine. This is will hopefully help more pages to optomize themselves for mobile devices throughout the next few years.</p>
